Uncertainty is a prevalent characteristic of contemporary life, and a central challenge of HCI.
During the workshop, we won’t seek to “solve” uncertainty but rather expand the ways in which we think about and navigate it. In doing so, we will experiment with and contribute to new practices, methods, and concepts for embracing uncertainty. Outcomes of the workshop will include documentation of exercises designed to evoke uncertainty in participants, concept mappings, and a collection of short essays written and refined by participants.
