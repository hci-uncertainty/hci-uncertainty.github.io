Uncertainty is a prevalent characteristic of contemporary life, and a central challenge of HCI.
During the workshop, we won’t seek to “solve” uncertainty but rather expand the ways in which we think about and navigate it. We will explore new practices, methods, and concepts for embracing uncertainty. 

Outcomes of the workshop will include documentation of exercises designed to evoke uncertainty in participants, concept mappings, and a collection of short essays written and refined by participants.

* Examples of original research, artworks, films, pictorials, or other creative pieces that deal with questions of uncertainty in HCI in novel or compelling fashion.
* Practice-based or methods pieces that explore HCI and design strategies for coping with, leveraging, or otherwise engaging uncertainty.
* Additional formats, including essays that draw upon historical approaches to dealing with uncertainty, theoretical pieces, or otherwise will be considered. Feel free to email organizers with questions or ideas. 

The workshop will take place as part of the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Honolulu, Hawaii during April 2020.
