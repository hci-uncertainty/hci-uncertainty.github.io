Uncertainty is a prevalent characteristic of contemporary life, and a central challenge of HCI.

During the workshop, we won’t seek to “solve” uncertainty but rather expand the ways in which we think about and navigate it. We will explore new practices, methods, and concepts for embracing uncertainty. 

Outcomes of the workshop will include documentation of exercises designed to evoke uncertainty in participants, concept mappings, and a collection of short essays written and refined by participants.

### Workshop Activities
#### Experiencing/Feeling Uncertainty Exercise:
The day will begin with a design activity facilitated by the Superflux Instant Archetypes Tarot Card Deck. This sensitizing activities will scaffold an opening discussion around the broader connections between design work and broader cultural narratives around uncertainty--shared values in big data and astrology, for instance---that will inspire conversations/debates for the rest of the day.  

####  Concept Mapping Exercises:
In an effort to organize the discussion, and produce a set of conceptual resources for participants to leave with at the end of the day, all activities will be organized in parallel with the creation and update of an ongoing concept map. This physical paper-based 2D  “map” will be created on top of a large table, and aims to establish a terrain of terms, methods, practices, and example projects that emerge. Entries to the map will be structured through the use of color and prompts to provide coherence to the format as it develops. It will take shape, morph, and grow more detailed throughout the day. 

####  Keyword Panels:
Drawing on submissions from participants and organizers, two “keyword” panels will feature presentations on concepts related to uncertainty. Keywords, in the framing of Raymond Williams, aren’t strict definitions but rather a mode of analysis that seeks to engage in a productive fashion with complex, contested, or multiple meanings of terms with significant social currency. Each panel will feature several short presentations from participants as well as a discussant, leaving ample time for discussion at the end. These panels will further enrich participants’ conception of the range of ways that uncertainty intersects with HCI research and practice.

#### Documentation Sprint:
Toward the close of the workshop, participants will collaborate to document the activities of the day and outcomes of the experiencing/feeling exercises, keyword panels, and concept mapping. Documentation methods will include: note-taking, sketching, photography, and zine production. Craft materials and other supplies will be provided by the organizers.

### Call for Participation

Call For Participation
This one-day workshop aims to convene HCI researchers working in a wide array of domains including games, sustainable HCI, social justice, machine learning, and others for an experiential and conceptual encounter with uncertainty. 

To apply, please send a 4-page position paper to hciuncertainty@gmail.com before February 12th 2020. Position papers should be the ACM Extended Abstract format and take one of the following forms: 

* “Keyword” style essays that take on topics related to uncertainty in HCI, including but not limited to: risk,  speculation, precarity, ambiguity, instability, hope, precision, underdetermination, insurance. 
* Examples of original research, artworks, films, pictorials, or other creative pieces that deal with questions of uncertainty in HCI in novel or compelling fashion.
* Practice-based or methods pieces that explore HCI and design strategies for coping with, leveraging, or otherwise engaging uncertainty.
* Additional formats, including essays that draw upon historical approaches to dealing with uncertainty, theoretical pieces, or otherwise will be considered. Feel free to email organizers with questions or ideas. 

The workshop will take place as part of the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Honolulu, Hawaii during April 2020. More information about the conference is here: [https://chi2020.acm.org](https://chi2020.acm.org). At least one author of each accepted position paper will be required to register for the workshop and at least one day of the conference.
